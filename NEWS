NEWS/Changelog

0.1-3	2012-11-05
    o	add support for 12-bit grayscale TIFF images in readTIFF()
	(Note that 12-bit TIFFs are outside of the standard, so
	we assume big-endian packing order)

	values used in the TIFF as they are (if applicable) instead
	of rescaling to reals

0.1-2	2012-08-30
    o	fixed a bug in writeTIFF() for 16-bit images


0.1-1	2012-08-24
    o	add readTIFF(..., indexed=TRUE) which return indexed images as
	color map and an index matrix.

    o	fixed a bug in writing a TIFF file consisting of multiple
	subimages

    o	prevent TIFF from re-entering error calls
